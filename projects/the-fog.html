        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          <em>The Fog</em> is an ongoing body of work centered around the
          politics of knowledge making, data collection, and trans visibility
          through an exploration of fog as a common subject/trope of horror
          narratives as well as metaphor used in military strategy. This work
          asks:
        </p>
        <p>
          Why has fog been figured as a menace in the popular imagination? Can
          fog be an aspirational figure for trans embodiment and resistance?
          What would embodiment styled after fog feel and look like?
        </p>

            >My Words To Victor Frankstein…</a
          >) around the idea of trans identity and the monstrous, the work will
          question how subjects are perceived as monstrous and what the process
          says about the societies that produce them. Instead of investing in
          assimilation as a goal, this work seeks to imagine new trans futures
          constructed outside of cis-centric models of being.

        <h3>San José Museum of Art - Digital Project Commission</h3>
        <p>November 3, 2023 - Ongoing</p>
        <p>
          <em>The Fog</em> (2023) explores our relationship to fog as a society
          and the potential for fog to serve as a positive role model for trans
          embodiment. Each scene is built as a procedurally generated 3D space
          using <a target="_blank" href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>. The
          work has been designed as a website without ads or tracking and with
          intentionally open source code. Sustainability and accessibility also
          informed the design choices for the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work makes extensive use of ASCII art stylization. This style is
          used to break away from an emphasis on graphic fidelity as an
          indicator of quality/value, to further accentuate the computational
          nature of the scenes, and because of the way ASCII art changes subtly
          across browsers and resists standardization documentation via
          screenshot.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project has been separated into 3 acts. I am calling them "acts"
          because each composition has been structured as a stage of sorts, each
          with its own mode of interaction and set of relational elements. Some
          elements in each act are procedurally generated, meaning that their
          shape, position, content, or other features are generated via code
          every time the page is loaded. This allows the work to have an element
          of controlled randomness which I find useful for creating these stages
          meant for contemplation over narrative.

        <h3>Fog Lights</h3>

        <p>
          <em>Fog Lights</em> (2023) is a set of 3 code sculptures exploring the
          visual language of lights meant to pierce fog in combination with
          texts exploring subject matter and archival material related to my San
          José Museum of Art commission and broader fog research. These 3
          objects are made with: Raspberry Pi computers, LCD screens, code
          (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), glass panels, and 3D printed cases. The
          cases and glass gesture to fog light fixtures but instead of emanating
          a strong light, the objects glow subtly with shifting text, beckoning
          the viewer closer to the objects. This work was first exhibited in New
          York City at
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dunkunsthalle.com/"
            >Dunkunsthalle</a

        <h3>Fog Pill</h3>

        <p>
          <em>Fog Pill</em> (2022), the first on the subject of fog, focused on
          imagining a future form of embodiment that meshes human corporeal form
          with that of fog. This speculative design work imagined a pill that
          could be ingested in order to turn one's sweat glands into fog
          producing glands. The result of this invention would be the ability to
          produce one's own fog layer at will as a form of visual resistance,
          personal expression, and potentially rehabilitate restoration.
          Focusing on the choice of when and how to be seen, this work imagines
          a future where these choices around visibility can link up to broader
          ecological concerns around reduced fog coverage due to climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
          What would it mean to be able to shroud one's self in fog? To be able
          to hide from view, obscure ones presence? What would this mean in the
          context of a world in desperate need of more fog? If a walk in the
          woods could be restorative to your body and the bodies around you?
        </p>
        <p>
          This work takes the form of a 2D document in the style of a patent or
          schematic drawing that outlines this speculative design. It also
          includes a 3D AR animation that illustrates the design in action.

        <p>
          There is more work to come in this series, including sculptures,
          artist books, and more coded works. Below is an in-progress image of a
          cast bronze “fog self portrait” made by melting down a bronze self
          portrait I made in 2015. The berlow image shows the bronze form and
          the 3D printed model it was cast from.
