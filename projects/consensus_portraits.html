        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Consensus Portraits</i> is a series of still images and videos that
          bring machine learning algorithms into conversation with one another
          in order to explore the reality these systems reproduce. These works
          explore that bias baked into machine learning systems meant to
          categorize people while also inviting a closer reading of these images
          and the digital material specificity/artifacting that belies the
          algorithms source material.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first works in this series used images from
          <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/"
            >This Person Does Not Exist</a
          >
          which were animated using
          <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/deep-nostalgia">Deep Nostalgia</a
          >. These synthetic moving portraits were then analyzed by the same
          facial recognition software I used in my Landmarks project. In this
          series, I was interested in the uncanny valley and the ability for
          algorithms to understand each other. The video at the top of the page
          is from that initial series.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current in progress series is a set of still images created by
          asking the image generation software
          <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2">DALLÂ·E 2</a> to create
          transwomen. These images were then fed into another algorithm tasked
          with identifying and categorizing faces. The resulting images are of
          overwhelmingly white figures whose bodies and surroundings belie the
          supposed neutrality of these systems. Three images from the series can
          be found below.
