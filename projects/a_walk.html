        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          This is a work in progress that employs both a browser-based
          experience and a physical sculptural artist's book to explore the
          liberatory power of being enshrouded by darkness or fog. I am
          interested in creating interactive experiences that allow viewers to
          reclaim or reimagine darkness and fog as empowering spaces for trans
          and queer thriving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extending from recent work on fog and recent explorations on darkness,
          this work will use text, imagery, and interaction design to foster a
          kinship with obfuscation and imagine a turn from the fear of the
          unknown to the power of the unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an artist I have always been interested in artist books, zines,
          toys, and interactive ephemera, and I see websites as an extension of
          this interest. Part artist tool/toy and part artist publication, I
          view websites as extremely rich sites for creative and emotional
          exploration. <i>A Walk in the Dark</i> is situated within this
          web-based art making framework. Drawing on past works developed with
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this work will employ procedural generation
          and user interaction to create individualized viewer experiences. The
          same design ethos and procedural thinking will be used to develop a
          physical artist's book with a modular tunnel book design.
