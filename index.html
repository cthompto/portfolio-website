      <h2>Recent and Ongoing Work:</h2>
      <h3><i>A Walk in the Dark</i></h3>
      <p>
        This is a work in progress that employs both a browser-based experience
        and a physical sculptural artist's book to explore the liberatory power
        of being enshrouded by darkness or fog. I am interested in creating
        interactive experiences that allow viewers to reclaim or reimagine
        darkness and fog as empowering spaces for trans and queer thriving. The
        digital portion of this work was developed during a 2024

      <h3><em>Consensus Sensing</em></h3>
      <p>
        Created for <i>The Wrong Biennale</i>, <i>Consensus Sensing</i> is a
        continuation of my series of investigative experiments into the
        transphobia baked into AI image generation. This project expands my
        image series <i>Consensus Portraits</i> into an online interactive
        archive with a custom user interface containing footnotes, context, and
        overlays, inviting viewers to closely read the images. This work is
        currently on display as part of the
        <i><a href="https://www.publicaccessmemories.com/">Debox</a></i>
        pavilion/exhibition hosted by Public Access Memories.

      <h3><i>The Fog</i></h3>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I have been making work that considers fog as
        an aspirational figure for trans embodiment. Recently, some new pieces
        and in forms of old pieces from this research have been shown in
        Bloomington Indiana as part of the<a

        One of the works in the show was <i>The Fog</i> from 2023, displayed
        here for the first time in an installation format:
