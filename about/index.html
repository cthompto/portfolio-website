              Chelsea Thompto (she/her) is a transdisciplinary artist and
              educator working at the intersections of art, trans studies, and
              technology. Her research based studio practice spans a variety of
              media which often include code, video, sound, writing, and
              sculpture and her work has been shown nationally and
              internationally. Born and raised in Iowa, she has spent most of
              her life between the Midwest and California and is now an
              Assistant Professor of Creative Technologies at Virginia Tech and
              serves as the Executive Editor of

        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In my art practice, I am animated by questions. Questions drive my
          research, which ultimately drives my making. Some notable questions
          that have driven my studio work in recent years include:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-bottom: 0px">
          <li>Who made the river a cyborg?</li>
          <li>
            What would happen if the spine of a book was a point rather than a
            line?
          </li>
          <li>
            As a trans person, is it better to be seen accurately, or not seen
            at all?
          </li>
          <li>
            Can fog be an aspirational figure for trans embodiment and
            resistance?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Through questions like these, I begin to create the objects, scenes,
          and interactions that form the basis of new works. These questions
          stem from an ongoing fixation with the politics of visibility, and my
          lived experience as a transwoman in the United States. More
          specifically, I am focused on the trans body as a site of contemporary
          productions of the inhuman, and of violence (physical, emotional,
          institutional, and otherwise) committed in the ongoing effort to reify
          gender as a binary system. My practice is centered around a critical
          engagement with current and historical systems of codification and
          control, to draw the viewer into an affective exploration of what it
          means to inhabit a fluid body subjected to colonial logics of
          visualization meant to fix, delineate, and stabilize. The imagery
          generated by and surrounding these systems is co-opted and enfolded
          into the work itself, to interrogate the types of knowledge they
          produce.
          <br /><br />
          I am deeply invested in material specificity, leveraging the inherent
          qualities (which are always contested and culturally situated) of
          materials is a central part of my practice. With technical knowledge
          that includes code, video, digital fabrication, traditional sculptural
          processes, writing, and bookbinding, I move works across and through
          different materials and processes to explore their formal and
          conceptual potential. This process enacts ‚Äútrans-‚Äù as a tactic and
          gesture for art making. This movement of ideas across the through
          materials fundamentally changes my relationship to the material from a
          fixed understanding of ‚Äúmaterial as meaning‚Äù towards a more fluid
          understanding of ‚Äúmaterial as lens or framework‚Äù. Within this
          transdisciplinary approach, intricate systems are employed to create
          visual form, articulate data, and allude to our habitual ordering of
          people and behaviors.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout my art making and writing, I am drawn towards producing
          work that challenges the harmful systems and paradigms that currently
          threaten trans folks, and have begun to move towards production that
          imagines more livable futures for trans people. I believe that any
          future facing work must acknowledge our climate crisis. To this end, I
          have begun to engage more directly with the ways our relationships to
          art and technology impact our climate future, and how we might rethink
          these relationships moving forward. These engagements have impacted my
          material choices in the studio, and the logistical considerations of
          my intellectual production and professional practice as a whole.

          in mind. First, the site does not track or collect user data in any

          about why this is important by the LA Times, it covers cookies and
          data privacy. Second, the site is designed to run as efficiently as
          possible and to only serve high quality images and videos when you
          arrive at pages related to specific projects as a method of reducing
          the overall environmental impact of the site. This is why you will see
